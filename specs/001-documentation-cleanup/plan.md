# Implementation Plan: Documentation Cleanup and Consolidation

**Branch**: `001-documentation-cleanup` | **Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Spec**: /specs/001-documentation-cleanup/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-documentation-cleanup/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This implementation plan focuses on consolidating and cleaning up the LightRAG project documentation by extracting important information from scattered docs into a centralized README.md file, while deprecating and archiving outdated documentation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Bash/Shell Scripts, Markdown
**Primary Dependencies**: File system operations, text processing utilities
**Storage**: File system (no database required)
**Testing**: Shell script testing, manual verification
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL2)
**Project Type**: Documentation maintenance (single project)
**Performance Goals**: Fast file operations, reliable text processing
**Constraints**: Preserve all critical information, maintain existing file permissions, ensure no data loss
**Scale/Scope**: Single repository documentation cleanup, affecting ~6 documentation files

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **I. Container-First Architecture**: This documentation cleanup task operates on existing file structures and does not require new containerized components. No violations.

✅ **II. Multi-LLM Provider Support**: This task involves documentation maintenance only and does not affect LLM provider configurations. No violations.

✅ **III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All file operations will be implemented with proper testing following GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structure. Documentation changes will include verification scripts.

✅ **IV. Security-First Design**: File operations will maintain existing permissions and security measures. No new security-sensitive operations are introduced.

✅ **V. Lightweight & Performance**: File operations are lightweight text processing with minimal resource usage. Performance monitoring will be included for any processing operations.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project documentation maintenance approach

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh windsurf`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load research.md and data-model.md to understand documentation structure
- Generate tasks for each documentation file requiring analysis and consolidation
- Create verification tasks for each consolidation step
- Generate file operation tasks for moving deprecated documentation
- Include testing tasks following TDD principles

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Analysis and planning tasks before implementation tasks
- Dependency order: Extract information before consolidating, consolidate before moving files
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent documentation analysis tasks)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on:
- Documentation analysis and information extraction
- README.md consolidation and reorganization
- File operations for deprecated documentation
- Verification and testing of all changes

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
