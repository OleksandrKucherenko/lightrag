# Documentation Cleanup Research

## Decision: Documentation Consolidation Strategy
**Chosen Approach**: Consolidate scattered documentation into a single, well-organized README.md while preserving specialized information in appropriate locations.

**Rationale**: The current documentation is fragmented across multiple files in the `docs/` directory, making it difficult for users to find essential information. Consolidating into README.md provides a single entry point while maintaining links to detailed documentation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep all documentation in separate files (rejected - poor user experience)
- Create a documentation website (rejected - overkill for current needs)
- Use a documentation generator like MkDocs (rejected - adds complexity without clear benefit)

## Decision: Deprecation Strategy
**Chosen Approach**: Move outdated/redundant documentation to `.deprecated/` directory with clear migration notes.

**Rationale**: Preserves historical documentation while cleaning up the main documentation space. Allows users to still access deprecated information if needed.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Delete deprecated files entirely (rejected - potential data loss)
- Keep all files in docs/ with deprecation notices (rejected - clutters main documentation)

## Decision: Information Extraction Method
**Chosen Approach**: Manual review and extraction of key information from each documentation file.

**Rationale**: Ensures accuracy and proper context preservation during consolidation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Automated text extraction (rejected - may lose important context)
- AI-assisted summarization (rejected - potential for inaccuracies)

## Decision: Testing and Verification
**Chosen Approach**: Create comprehensive verification scripts following TDD principles.

**Rationale**: Ensures all changes are properly tested and documented.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual verification only (rejected - error-prone)
- No verification (rejected - violates constitution requirements)

## Key Findings from Documentation Review

### TESTING.md
- Contains comprehensive test framework documentation
- Includes GIVEN/WHEN/THEN pattern examples
- Provides test categories and troubleshooting guides
- Should be referenced in README testing section

### caddy-docker-proxy-implementation-plan.md
- Technical implementation details for Caddy configuration
- May be outdated if implementation is complete
- Contains troubleshooting information that could be useful

### lightrag-performance-optimization-guide.md
- Detailed performance tuning recommendations
- Specific configuration examples
- Important for production deployments

### Other Documentation Files
- `custom-domain-name.md`: Domain configuration guidance
- `performance-monitoring-benchmark.md`: Performance monitoring details
- All contain valuable information that should be preserved

## Implementation Requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing documentation references
- Ensure no critical information is lost during consolidation
- Provide clear migration path for deprecated documentation
- Follow security-first approach for any file operations
