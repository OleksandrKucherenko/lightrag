# Feature Specification: Documentation Cleanup and Consolidation

**Feature Branch**: `001-documentation-cleanup`
**Created**: 2025-01-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "we need to cleanup documentation of the solution and make it clean and easy to understand. review @[docs] folder and extract from it important information into @[README.md] file, after processing we can mark specific documents deprecated and move them to .deprecated directory"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or maintainer of the LightRAG project, I want the documentation to be consolidated and clean so that I can easily understand how to set up, configure, and use the system without having to search through multiple scattered documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new developer looking at the project, **When** I read the README.md file, **Then** I should find all essential setup, configuration, and usage information in one place
2. **Given** I need to troubleshoot an issue, **When** I look for testing information, **Then** I should find comprehensive testing documentation easily accessible from the README
3. **Given** I want to optimize performance, **When** I search for performance guidance, **Then** I should find performance optimization information clearly documented
4. **Given** I need to understand the system architecture, **When** I read the documentation, **Then** I should find clear architectural information without having to piece it together from multiple sources

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation contains conflicting information?
- How does the system handle outdated documentation that might still be referenced?
- What if some documentation is highly technical and needs to be simplified for the README?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a consolidated README.md that contains all essential information for setup, configuration, and usage
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and extract important information from existing documentation files in the docs/ folder
- **FR-003**: System MUST organize information in a logical, easy-to-follow structure in the README
- **FR-004**: System MUST mark outdated or redundant documentation files as deprecated
- **FR-005**: System MUST move deprecated documentation files to the .deprecated directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all critical information is preserved and accessible in the consolidated README
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain links to specialized documentation that cannot be consolidated

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Documentation File]**: Represents individual markdown files containing project information, with attributes like file path, content type, and importance level
- **[README Section]**: Represents organized sections within the main README.md file that group related information
