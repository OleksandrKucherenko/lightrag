## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY (streamlined check creation)
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no specific template engines, file structures)
- 👥 Written for development teams and DevOps stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs to create a new test check for the LightRAG configuration verification system. They want to ensure the check follows established TDD patterns, integrates seamlessly with the existing framework, and can be created quickly without manual boilerplate coding.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has identified a need for a new security check, **When** they use the `/check` command with a natural language description, **Then** a properly structured check script is generated following TDD patterns
2. **Given** a generated check script exists, **When** the verification orchestrator runs, **Then** the new check is automatically discovered and executed with other checks
3. **Given** a developer wants to create a PowerShell check for Windows integration, **When** they specify the script type in their request, **Then** the system generates a PowerShell script with appropriate Windows-specific patterns
4. **Given** a check template is updated, **When** new checks are generated, **Then** they automatically inherit the latest template improvements and patterns
5. **Given** a developer creates a check interactively, **When** they are prompted for TDD structure, **Then** they must provide GIVEN/WHEN/THEN descriptions before the check is generated

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer requests a check that already exists?
- How does the system handle malformed natural language input for check creation?
- What occurs when template dependencies are missing from the system?
- How does validation behave when generated scripts have syntax errors?
- What happens when the same check name is requested for different script types?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide template-based check script generation using structured templates
- **FR-002**: System MUST support natural language parsing for check creation requests via `/check` command
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce TDD methodology by requiring GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structure in all generated checks
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple script types (Bash, PowerShell, CMD) with appropriate templates
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate generated check scripts for syntax correctness and pattern compliance
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate generated checks with existing verification orchestrator for auto-discovery
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide interactive check creation mode for detailed customization
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure generated checks follow the established naming pattern: {group}-{service}-{test}.{ext}
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that generated checks produce output in STATUS|CHECK_NAME|MESSAGE|COMMAND format
- **FR-010**: System MUST support check creation for all existing categories: security, storage, communication, environment, monitoring, performance, wsl2
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide template management capabilities (list, validate, update templates)
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with Windsurf workflow system following established workflow patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent creation of duplicate checks with appropriate conflict resolution
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide comprehensive validation pipeline including syntax, pattern, and integration testing
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing check scripts and orchestrator functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Check generation MUST complete within 30 seconds for standard templates
- **NFR-002**: Generated checks MUST be immediately executable without additional configuration
- **NFR-003**: Template system MUST be extensible to support new check categories and script types
- **NFR-004**: Natural language parsing MUST handle common variations in developer requests
- **NFR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages and guidance when check creation fails
- **NFR-006**: Generated checks MUST maintain consistent code quality and documentation standards

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Check Template**: Structured template files containing boilerplate code, placeholders for customization, and TDD structure guidance
- **Generated Check Script**: Executable test script created from templates, following framework patterns and naming conventions
- **Template Metadata**: Information about template variables, expected inputs, validation rules, and supported script types
- **Validation Result**: Output from syntax checking, pattern validation, and integration testing of generated checks
- **Workflow Request**: Natural language input from `/check` command containing check requirements and preferences
- **Check Configuration**: Structured data containing group, service, test name, script type, and TDD structure for template processing

## Business Value & Impact

### Primary Benefits
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduces check creation time from 30-60 minutes to 2-5 minutes
- **Quality Consistency**: Ensures all checks follow established TDD patterns and framework conventions
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates common mistakes in check script structure and output formatting
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Templates encode best practices and make them accessible to all team members
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Template updates automatically improve all future check generation

### Success Metrics
- Time to create new check reduced by 80%
- 100% of generated checks pass validation pipeline
- Zero manual corrections needed for framework integration
- Developer satisfaction score >4.5/5 for check creation experience
- 95% of checks created via template system vs manual creation

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing verification orchestrator (tests/verify.configuration.v3.sh) must remain functional
- Windsurf workflow system must be available for `/check` command integration
- Template engine (external dependency) must be installable and accessible
- Current check script patterns and output formats must be maintained

### Assumptions
- Developers are familiar with TDD methodology and GIVEN/WHEN/THEN structure
- Natural language input will follow common patterns for technical requests
- Template system will be used for majority of new check creation
- Existing check scripts will not require migration to template system

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Template-based check script generation
- Windsurf `/check` command workflow integration
- Multi-platform script support (sh/ps1/cmd)
- TDD structure enforcement
- Validation pipeline for generated checks
- Auto-discovery integration with orchestrator
- Interactive and workflow-based creation modes

### Out of Scope
- Migration of existing check scripts to template system
- Modification of existing orchestrator core functionality
- Custom template creation by end users
- Integration with external CI/CD systems
- Performance testing of generated checks
- Automated check execution scheduling

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Template engine dependency availability and compatibility
- Natural language parsing accuracy for diverse input patterns
- Integration complexity with existing Windsurf workflow system

### Medium Risk
- Template maintenance overhead as framework evolves
- User adoption rate for new template system vs manual creation
- Validation pipeline performance with complex check scripts

### Low Risk
- Backward compatibility with existing check scripts
- File system permissions for template and check directories
- Cross-platform script execution differences
